Remember to put this  verbosity:
        closest_player_rating_name = find_similar_string(player.name, player_rating_names_list, similarity_threshold=0.6, verbose=True)

To True so you can  check the ones with less than 100%

Also, for specific cases, you can also search "verbose=False" in the specific find_similar_string and put it to True
